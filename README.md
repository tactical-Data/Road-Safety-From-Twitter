# Why it matters
It can be difficult for the public at large to get data on road safety. Specifically when, where and under what conditions accidents are most likely to occur (and therefore best avoided). This model demonstrates that the ODOT Twitter feed can be used for this purpose.  
- A tree analysis is used to derive some "rules of thumb" for accident avoidance.  
- Accident "hot spots" - short section of road with a majority of accidents- are also found.
